[:globe_with_meridians: Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/){target=_blank} has been a shining beacon of Free and Open Source software from the early 1970's and has grown to be a versatile set of development tools for all languages.  This long history has given [:globe_with_meridians: Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/){target=_blank} the ability to interact with almost every aspect of your digital life.

## Practicalli Spacemacs configuration

[:fontawesome-brands-github: practicalli/spacemacs-config](https://github.com/practicalli/spacemacs-config){target=_blank} contains a rich configuration for Clojure development and supporting tools, including support for Clojure LSP with minimally distracting UI elements.

=== "Free Desktop XDG Config"
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/practicalli/spacemacs-config.git $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/spacemacs`
    ```
    The above command creates the `~/.config/spacemacs/init.el` that contains the configuration used in Practicalli Spacemacs book, all in one place.

=== "Classic Config"
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/practicalli/spacemacs-config.git $HOME/.spacemacs.d`
    ```
    The above command creates the `~/.spacemacs.d/init.el` that contains the configuration used in Practicalli Spacemacs book, all in one place.


[:fontawesome-brands-github: Practicalli Spacemacs config](https://github.com/practicalli/spacemacs-config){target=_blank} uses a Gruvbox Light theme and the simplified Doom mode line theme, which can be readily changed.

# Vim Basics

Vim style editing uses multiple states for specific tasks, enabling simple keybindings that are consistent and easy to learn through repetition.

![Spacemacs States](/images/spacemacs-states--vertical.png)

* **normal** - for manipulating and navigating existing text
* **insert** - for writing new text
* **visual** - for selecting blocks of text
* **iedit** - edit multiple regions (i.e. multiple cursors)
* **lisp** - structural editing for Clojure & Lisp style languages (e.g. slurp, barf)

First get familiar with **normal**, **insert** and **visual** states.  Then when you are comfortable, move on to **iedit** and **lisp** states.

## Learning Vim

Start learning the basics of Vim in Spacemacs by following the built-in Evil tutorial: `SPC h T`

Review the [Vim quick reference](vim-quick-reference.html) regularly and pick up a few keybindings each time you are using Spacemacs.  The more often you use these keybindings, the sooner they will become ingrained.

# Deleting symbols, words & expressions 

In lisp-state you can easily delete symbols, words and expressions without deleting the structures they are in (unless that structure is empty).

Delete a symbol, word or expression using the `d` menu

| lisp-state | Description                   |
|------------|-------------------------------|
| `d s`      | delete the current symbol     |
| `d w`      | delete the current word       |
| `d x`      | delete the current expression |

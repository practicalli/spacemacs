The guide contains specific sections on Clojure development, although the majority of the content is applicable to any language. Why Spacemacs Install Spacemacs Clojure Development Emacs has been a shining beacon of Free and Open Source software from the early 1970's and has grown to be a versatile set of development tools for all languages. This long history has given Emacs the ability to interact with almost every aspect of your digital life. Spacemacs is a community configuration providing a consistent and simple to learn approach to using all the features and power of Emacs . Spacemacs also integrates the raw text manipulation speed of Vim and multi-modal editing into the Emacs experience, enabling you to be even more productive.

The clear language design is supported by a powerful development environment known as the REPL (read, evaluate, print, loop). The REPL gives you instant feedback on what your code does and enables you to test either a single expression or run the whole application (including tests). REPL driven development is the foundation of working with Clojure effectively Coding with a REPL provides instant feedback as design decisions are coded. The REPL feedback helps test the assumptions that are driving the design choices. Important design choices should be codified in unit tests, optionally using spec. Read - code is read by the Clojure reader, passing any macros to the macro reader which converts those macros into Clojure code. Evaluate - code is compiled into the host language (e.g. Java bytecode) and executed Print - results of the code are displayed, either in the REPL or as part of the application. Loop - the REPL is a continuous process that evaluates code, either a single expression or the whole application. Always be REPL'ing Coding without a REPL feels like so limiting. I want instant fast feedback from my code as I craft it, testing my assumptions and design choices every step of the journey to a solution - John Stevenson, Practical.li Evaluating source code \u03bb\ufe0e A REPL connected editor is the primary tool for evaluating Clojure code from source code files, displaying the results inline. Source code is evaluated in its respective namespace, removing the need to change namespaces in the REPL directly, ( in-ns ), or use fully qualified names to call functions. Evaluate Clojure in Spacemacs , e f evaluates the top level form under the cursor, , e e evaluated the expression immediately before the cursor (useful for evaluating nested expressions) Hint , e ; ( cider-eval-defun-to-comment ) evaluates the current form and prints the result under the expression as a comment Adding result comment is an effective way to show the expected results of the code design, especially as a journal. Rich Comment blocks - living documentation \u03bb\ufe0e The (comment ,,,) function wraps code that is only run directly by the developer using a Clojure aware editor . Expressions in rich comment blocks can represent how to use the functions that make up the namespace API. For example, starting/restarting the system, updating the database, etc. Expressions provide examples of calling functions with typical arguments and make a project more accessible and easier to work with. Rich comment blocks are very useful for rapidly iterating over different design decisions by including the same function but with different implementations. Hide clj-kondo linter warnings for redefined vars ( def , defn ) when using this approach. ;; Rich comment block with redefined vars ignored # _ { :clj-kondo/ignore [ :redefined-var ]} ( comment ( defn value-added-tax [] ;; algorithm design - first try) ( defn value-added-tax [] ;; algorithm design - first try) ) ;; End of rich comment block The \"Rich\" in the name is an honourary mention to Rich Hickey, the author and benevolent dictator of Clojure design. Design Journal \u03bb\ufe0e A journal of design decisions makes the code easier to understand and maintain. Code examples of design decisions and alternative design discussions are captured, reducing the time spent revisiting those discussions. Journals simplify the developer on-boarding processes as the journey through design decisions are already documented. A Design Journal is usually created in a separate namespace, although it may start as a rich comment at the bottom of a namespace. A journal should cover the following aspects Relevant expressions use to test assumptions about design options. Examples of design choices not taken and discussions why (saves repeating the same design discussions) Expressions that can be evaluated to explain how a function or parts of a function work The design journal can be used to create meaningful documentation for the project very easily and should prevent time spent on repeating the same conversations. Example design journal Design journal for TicTacToe game using Reagent, ClojureScript and Scalable Vector Graphics Viewing data structures \u03bb\ufe0e Pretty print shows the structure of results from function calls in a human-friendly form, making it easier for a developer to parse and more likely to notice incorrect results. , e p on the Spacemacs Clojure menu has several commands to Pretty Print data structure results when evaluating code. , d v is the Cider Inspect menu for paging through very large data sets and navigate nested data structures in detail. , d is the Cider debug menu which can inspect view intermediate values and data structures during the debugging of Clojure function calls. Cider inspector is an effective way to navigate nested data and page through large data sets. External data browsers can visualise data in many different forms. Code Style and idiomatic Clojure \u03bb\ufe0e Clojure aware editors should automatically apply formatting that follows the Clojure Style guide . Live linting with clj-kondo suggests common idioms and highlights a wide range of syntax errors as code is written, minimizing bugs and therefore speeding up the development process. Clojure Style Guide The Clojure Style guide provides examples of common formatting approaches, although the development team should decide which of these to adopt. Emacs clojure-mode will automatically format code and so will Clojure LSP (via cljfmt). These tools are configurable and should be tailored to the teams standard. Test Driven Development and REPL Driven Development \u03bb\ufe0e Test Driven Development (TDD) and REPL Driven Development (RDD) complement each other as they both encourage incremental changes and continuous feedback. Test Driven Development fits well with Hammock Time, as good design comes from deep thought RDD enables rapid design experiments so different approaches can easily and quickly be evaluated . TDD focuses the results of the REPL experiments into design decisions, codified as unit tests. These tests guide the correctness of specific implementations and provide critical feedback when changes break that design. Unit tests should support the public API of each namespace in a project to help prevent regressions in the code. Its far more efficient in terms of thinking time to define unit tests as the design starts to stabilize than as an after thought. clojure.test library is part of the Clojure standard library that provides a simple way to start writing unit tests. Clojure spec can also be used for generative testing, providing far greater scope in values used when running unit tests. Specifications can be defined for values and functions. Clojure has a number of test runners available. Kaocha is a test runner that will run unit tests and function specification checks. Automate local test runner Use kaocha test runner in watch mode to run tests and specification check automatically (when changes are saved) clojure -X:test/watch Continuous Integration and Deployment \u03bb\ufe0e Add a continuous integration service to run tests and builds code on every shared commit. Spin up testable review deployments when commits pushed to a pull request branch, before pushing commits to the main deployment branch, creating an effective pipeline to gain further feedback. CircleCI provides a simple to use service that supports Clojure projects. GitHub Workflows and GitHub actions marketplace to quickly build a tailored continuous integration service, e.g. Setup Clojure GitHub Action . GitLab CI Live Coding with Data - Stuart Halloway \u03bb\ufe0e There are few novel features of programming languages, but each combination has different properties. The combination of dynamic, hosted, functional and extended Lisp in Clojure gives developers the tools for making effective programs. The ways in which Clojure's unique combination of features can yield a highly effective development process. Over more than a decade we have developed an effective approach to writing code in Clojure whose power comes from composing many of its key features. As different as Clojure programs are from e.g. Java programs, so to can and should be the development experience. You are not in Kansas anymore!

A stack trace can seem daunting as it provide so much information. There are common errors that are useful to learn to help quickly understand the root cause. Clojure editors such as CIDER help navigation and information hiding. Tools like AvisoNovate/pretty reformat stack traces to make them easier to understand. Structure of a stack trace \u03bb\ufe0e The Clojure compiler will catch an error exception, unwrap, and re-throw exceptions up the call chain from where they originally occur. This provides a history of all the expressions called that lead to the exception. Exception in thread... should be at the top of the stack trace, followed by the call stack in descending chronological time Understanding Exception \u03bb\ufe0e An exception should provide a general context for the error and the assumed path to the error. IllegalArgumentException ClassCastException ArityException ClassNotFound Example Exceptions include: Don't know how to create ISeq from: clojure.lang.Keyword - a keyword was used when a sequence (list, vector) was expected Don't know how to create IFn from: clojure.lang.Integer - an expression was evaluated that started with a value (specifically an Integer) rather than a symbol that points to a function definition. Answer is often the first line \u03bb\ufe0e A stack trace is printed in descending time order, with the most recent call at the top of the stack. Between the Exception and the top of the call stack, most errors are quickly interpreted without the need to read the whole stack trace. Using the wrong kind of value \u03bb\ufe0e IllegalArgumentException is generated when using the wrong kind of value, e.g. using a value instead of a function name (symbol) Evaluating (1 2 3) will try and call 1 as a function as it is first in the list. As 1 is a value (integer) and not a function, so 1 does not implement the function interface, IFn . De-reference Values \u03bb\ufe0e Casting a value to a Future that has not been realised java.util.concurrent.Future Diagnosing Classpath issues \u03bb\ufe0e clojure -Spath > project-classpath.txt will write the output the project classpath to the project-classpath.txt file. The command will first download project dependencies that are not currently satisfied The output is a single line of text, with each path in the class path separated by a colon character, : SPC f f to open the file in Spacemacs Separate the classpath output into individual lines with this vim command ( : enters the command mode in the Emacs mini-buffer). This makes the file easier to read and run diff comparisons upon. : s /:/ \\ n / g Diff - compare differences between files SPC D f f and selecting two files will open ediff and show a comparison. Navigate the changes using j and k . a to copy a change from the left buffer to the right buffer, b to copy right to left. Reading and understanding Clojure errors \u03bb\ufe0e Define a function that explicitly throws an exception using the throw function ( defn explicit-exception [ value ] ( throw ( ex-info ( str \"Invalid value: \" value ) { :value value }))) ( explicit-exception \"kaboom\" ) Execution error ( ExceptionInfo ) at user/explicit-exception ( REPL :2 ) . Invalid value : kaboom Deconstructing the error message Execution error: - in which Clojure phase the error occurred ExceptionInfo : - name of the class of the exception. ex-info internally creates an instance of clojure.lang.ExceptionInfo user/explicit-exception - name of the function where exception was thrown REPL:2 - path and line of the file where exception was thrown. REPL means there is no file, the definition was created at the REPL prompt, on line 2 Invalid value: kaboom : - error message thrown (the message passed to ex-info in this example) Generate an exception by calling the function with the incorrect number of arguments ( explicit-exception ) Execution error ( ArityException ) at user/eval137 ( REPL :1 ) . Wrong number of args ( 0 ) passed to : user/explicit-exception Deconstructing the error message Execution error - the implicit execution error is the same as before ArityException - class of the exception, i.e. clojure.lang.ArityException user/eval137 - every form evaluated in the REPL internally creates a function, generating a name in the form eval1234 and immediately executes the expression. REPL:1 - error path is the first line of the REPL prompt Wrong number of args (0) passed to: user/explicit-exception - message generated from the exception Use an anonymous function to wrap the call to the expression, to provide an explicit name when evaluated (( fn named-for-context [] ( explicit-exception ))) Execution error ( ArityException ) at user/eval139$named-for-context ( REPL :2 ) . Wrong number of args ( 0 ) passed to : user/explicit-exception The error message function now includes a specific name making the error message more useful as it is more obvious in the code as to where the error occurred. View the stack trace \u03bb\ufe0e *e is a dynamic var that always points to the last error in a running REPL process. Evaluate *e in the REPL to see the stack trace in detail, as an EDN hash-map user => e* # error { :cause \"Wrong number of args (0) passed to: user/explicit-exception\" :via [{ :type clojure.lang.ArityException :message \"Wrong number of args (0) passed to: user/explicit-exception\" :at [ clojure.lang.AFn throwArity \"AFn.java\" 429 ]}] :trace [[ clojure.lang.AFn throwArity \"AFn.java\" 429 ] [ clojure.lang.AFn invoke \"AFn.java\" 28 ] [ user$eval139$named-for-context__140 invoke \"NO_SOURCE_FILE\" 2 ] ... ]} Adding named-for-context to the execution, anything before this context should not be relevant. Now let's try a harder one: Stack trace for Lazy functions \u03bb\ufe0e ( map explicit-exception [ 1 ]) Error printing return value ( ExceptionInfo ) at user/explicit-exception ( NO_SOURCE_FILE :2 ) . Invalid value : 1 Error printing return value at the start of the error shows it's not a Execution error anymore.

Separate these two in your mind. Focus first on the former (should not be too hard as you learned Lisp in the past). Use sites like Exercism to practice. Once you have a grip on the basics (loops, functions, variables, conditionals, etc), move on to the aspects that involve Emacs itself (changing text, switching buffers, etc). This is vast, and you'll likely get lost in a sea of details. There are a few things you should understand really well, as you'll use them often. They are: interactive save-excursion save-restriction hooks advising functions with-current-buffer Once you understand these, instead of spending all your time reading the ELisp reference, think of simple problems you have with Emacs that you want to write and try solving them with Elisp. You'll likely need help on some of the steps, and that's where Google can help you. Examples of problems I solved to practice my Elisp: When you use org-capture, and you write text in the last line of the capture buffer, it does not put a newline at the end, and so if I had any headlines after the capture position, that headline would no longer be a headline. The fix was to make a hook that checks if there are any newlines, and if not, add one at the end of the capture. When I capture and refile in one step, it doesn't save the file the entry was refiled to. But if I capture without refiling, it does. I fixed this inconsistency. When writing minutes during a meeting (in an org file), if a TODO for someone comes up, I want to do a capture that will look for a headline called TODOs (under the top level headline I am in) and place the TODO in there. Each meeting has its own TODOs headline, and it should go to the one for the current meeting in the file. This involved writing a function that goes up the tree to the top level, and looks for a child called TODOs. Kill all buffers of a certain mode (there may be an internal function that already does this, but I did not know it).

Separate these two in your mind. Focus first on the former (should not be too hard as you learned Lisp in the past). Use sites like Exercism to practice. Once you have a grip on the basics (loops, functions, variables, conditionals, etc), move on to the aspects that involve Emacs itself (changing text, switching buffers, etc). This is vast, and you'll likely get lost in a sea of details. There are a few things you should understand really well, as you'll use them often. They are: interactive save-excursion save-restriction hooks advising functions with-current-buffer Once you understand these, instead of spending all your time reading the ELisp reference, think of simple problems you have with Emacs that you want to write and try solving them with Elisp. You'll likely need help on some of the steps, and that's where Google can help you. Examples of problems I solved to practice my Elisp: When you use org-capture, and you write text in the last line of the capture buffer, it does not put a newline at the end, and so if I had any headlines after the capture position, that headline would no longer be a headline. The fix was to make a hook that checks if there are any newlines, and if not, add one at the end of the capture. When I capture and refile in one step, it doesn't save the file the entry was refiled to. But if I capture without refiling, it does. I fixed this inconsistency. When writing minutes during a meeting (in an org file), if a TODO for someone comes up, I want to do a capture that will look for a headline called TODOs (under the top level headline I am in) and place the TODO in there. Each meeting has its own TODOs headline, and it should go to the one for the current meeting in the file. This involved writing a function that goes up the tree to the top level, and looks for a child called TODOs. Kill all buffers of a certain mode (there may be an internal function that already does this, but I did not know it).

It is an interactive document that can update sections of itself from the code that runs inside. In Spacemacs and Clojure development, it means you could write a document explaining your project or library and include code that can execute and give results in the document itself. To encourage contributors to open source project or on-boarding a developer onto a team, a literate programming document that explains how all the important aspects work, including real code examples that they can experiment with, would remove barriers in becoming familiar with a project. Literate programming with Spacemacs \u03bb\ufe0e Emacs has Org-mode with can do amazing things with documents, simply open a file with a .org filename extension. Org-mode includes Babel, which can take code and run it in an Emacs buffer of the correct major-mode for the programming language and automatically return the result back to the org-mode file. Configure Literate Programming with Clojure \u03bb\ufe0e Include the org and clojure layers in the dotspacemacs-layer-configuration of the ~/.spacemacs configuration file. Create a Clojure project \u03bb\ufe0e Literate programming can be used with any working Clojure project, using either a deps.edn configuration or a Leiningen project.clj file.

Create an org file with Clojure code blocks \u03bb\ufe0e Create an org file, eg. literate-clojure.org in the root of the Clojure project. Write the text of the document and use , b d to add a code block, selecting clojure as the language. Add :results value after clojure in the code block BEGIN line. In the code block write your clojure code, e.g. (+ 1 2 3) Ctrl + C + Ctrl + c to evaluate the code block at the cursor point. The result is pasted underneath the code block. Clojure Literate programming examples \u03bb\ufe0e Starting with a very basic Clojure expression to test evaluation is working correctly.

There are many more things you can do within Clojure files and the REPL, so take a look at the Cider keyboard shortcuts (keybindings) once you have the basics mastered.","title":"Hint::CIDER keybindings have more cognitive load"},{"location":"reference/keybindings/vim-keybindings/","text":"Useful Vim key bindings \u03bb\ufe0e movement \u03bb\ufe0e 0 - beginning of line ^ - beginning of non-whitespace $ - end of line 9j - move down 9 lines w - move forward by word b - move backward by word gg - first line G - last line C-u - up half page C-d - down half page f/ - move forward to first \"/\" character t/ - move forward right before the first \"/\" character ; - repeat that command again H - head of the screen M - middle of the screen L - last of the screen } - move forward by paragraph or block { - move backwards by paragraph or block * - search for word under the cursor n - search again forward N - search again backwards # - search backwards for word under cursor / - search forward ? - search backward % - find matching brace, paren, etc ma - mark a line in a file with marker \"a\" `a - after moving around, go back to the exact position of marker \"a\" 'a - after moving around, go back to line of marker \"a\" :marks - view all the marks '' - go to the last place you were [{ - jump back to the \"{\" at the beginning of the current code block editing \u03bb\ufe0e x - delete char under cursor X - delete char before cursor A - add to end of line I - insert at the beginning of the line dd - delete line D - delete from cursor to end of line di' - delete text inside single quotes yy - copy line Y - copy from cursor to end of line cc - change line C - change from cursor to end of line cit - change text inside html tag ci' - change text inside single quotes ci{ - change text inside curly brackets. ci... - etc p - paste after cursor P = paste before cursor o - add line below O - add line above . = repeat last comment r - replace character R - replace.

(sp-select-next-thing &optional ARG POINT) Set active region over next thing as recognized by \u2018sp-get-thing\u2019. If ARG is positive N, select N expressions forward. If ARG is negative -N, select N expressions backward. If ARG is a raw prefix SPC u select all the things up until the end of current expression. If ARG is a raw prefix SPC u SPC u select the current expression (as if doing \u2018sp-backward-up-sexp\u2019 followed by \u2018sp-select-next-thing\u2019). If ARG is number 0 (zero), select all the things inside the current expression.

Therefore calling this function twice with no active region will select the inside of the next expression. If the point is right in front of the expression any potential prefix is ignored. For example, \u2019|(foo) would only select (foo) and not include \u2019 in the selection. If you wish to also select the prefix, you have to move the point backwards.

Add an identity to Git configuration \u03bb\ufe0e Define your git identity using the following commands in a terminal window git config --global user.name \"practicalli\" git config --global user.email ***+github-account@noreploy.github.com These commands update the [user] section of the Git configuration file, automatically creating that file if it does not exist.

Access remote repositories \u03bb\ufe0e GitHub repositories can be accessed via HTTPS or SSH URL. SSH approach is typically more secure, especially as the files holding your keys on disk are encrypted. SSH connections can be tunnelled through HTTPS if connecting to a remote repository via a very restricted firewall. HTTPS is more widely supported in firewalls as it goes through the HTTPS port. A personal access token is typically required (GitHub blocks access via password), although it must be saved in a plain text file, e.g. ~/.github . Should a token be compromised, it does not give access to the account on the remote repository, so the token can be deleted easily. SSH URLs with SSH Key \u03bb\ufe0e When using SSH URLs for remote repository access, generate an SSH key and add it to your GitHub account . The SSH key removes the need to enter GitHub credentials each time a command is used that accesses a remote repository (push, pull, clone, etc.). SSH Key Passphrase \u03bb\ufe0e Practicalli recommends setting a passphrase when generating an SSH key. Unix systems (Linux / MacOSX) should have the ssh-keygen command. -t specifies the type of encryption, RSA recommended -C to add your GitHub email address to the SSH key ssh-keygen -t rsa -C \"654321+practicalli-john@users.noreply.github.com\" Accept the default file or enter a preferred file name Enter a passphrase. A 12 character or greater passphrase should provide adequate security. Repeat the passphrase The key has now been created, with an id_rsa.pub public key that should be added to you GitHub account. Saving SSH Key to Key Ring \u03bb\ufe0e A key-ring tool for the Operating System can be used to securely store the passphrase. Ubuntu desktop has a key-ring tool which will display a pop-up dialog to save the passphrase to the key-ring the first time the SSH key is used. Once saved, the key is unlocked when login into the desktop. HTTPS URLs and personal access token \u03bb\ufe0e When using HTTPS URLs for remote repository access, a personal access token is required. Visit the remote repository service and generate a personal access token with at least repo permission. GitHub personal access token documentation GitLab personal access token documentation Whilst the token could be added to the ~/.gitconfig , as this file is plain text it is not particularly secure (especially if committed into a dotfiles repository and shared). git config --global oauth.token \"tokens-in-plain-text-files-are-not-very-secure\" To provide greater security when using the token, consider using the Git Credential Manager . It is not known if this approach will work with magit (let Practicalli know if it does). Hint::Magit Forge also uses personal access token \u03bb\ufe0e Magit Forge also requires a personal access token , although this can be saved in the encrypted file ~/.authinfo.pgg for greater security. The Magit Forge token includes permissions required to access remote repositories over HTTPS For greater security, use separate tokens if placing the HTTPS tokein in a plain text file).

Force push a shared commit If a commit is changed after it is pushed to a remote repository, then a force push will be required. Please confirm with other maintainers of the code if a force push is acceptable as it could interrupt their development. A more suitable practice can be to create a new commit and push that rather than rewrite history. P opens the Push menu in Magit status buffer ( SPC g s ). -f sets the force-with-lease option to rewrite the shared history in the remote repository p pushes to the new commit to the remote repository and replaces the HEAD commit in that repository. Why amend a commit \u03bb\ufe0e Amend creates a new commit with both the currently staged changes and the change in the previous commit. If you forgot to include some changes in the last commit, then this is a way to avoid two commits for the same logical change. As amending also allows you to edit the commit message, this can be updated to fix errors or add more details. Reword commit message \u03bb\ufe0e c w allow you to reword the commit message of the previous commit. The new commit replaces the current HEAD commit. Any staged changes are ignored and not amended to the previous commit. Extend commit \u03bb\ufe0e c e will immediately add all staged changes to the previous commit, creating an new commit that replaces the previous commit. You are not prompted, so use this with caution. No prompt is given to edit the commit message, so this is only useful if you simply just missed a change or file and the commit message already describes the change in full detail. How to undo a commit extend O to select the Magit Reset menu. s for a soft reset, assuming you only wish to reset the commit (leaves staged and working files as they are). Select ORIG_HEAD to select the unchanged HEAD commit from the remote repository, assuming it has the required commit. Amending a commit that is not HEAD \u03bb\ufe0e Interactive rebasing is required to amend a commit that is not currently the HEAD commit. The amend command only works with the HEAD commit and Git doesn't provide a specific command for modifying a commit other than HEAD. Avoid amending shared commits Amending a commit will change the commit reference number (the SHA hash code) as this is based in part on the time of commit as well as the contents. Use the -f force flag to push an amended commit to a shared repository (e.g. GitHub or GitLab). P - f p to force push to the remote repository. Force push a shared commit \u03bb\ufe0e If you already shared a commit that you want to extend, please ask those you work with if its okay (as it could interrupt their development). For shared commits, its better practice to create a new commit and push that rather than rewrite history. P opens the Push menu in Magit status buffer ( SPC g s ). -f sets the force-with-lease option to rewrite the shared history in the remote repository p pushes to the new commit to the remote repository and replaces the HEAD commit in that repository. Squash Commits \u03bb\ufe0e c to enter the commit transient state menu s in the commit menu to amend a commit The top buffer shows the local Git log, listing all the commit history.

Why Squash commits \u03bb\ufe0e The commit history should help the development team understand the reasons for changes as well as what has actually changed. Squashing commits is useful for joining together commits that form a logical change. If a change is spread over several commits, then squashing those commits together can improve the commit history. Hint::Avoid squashing shared commits \u03bb\ufe0e Squashing a commit will change the commit reference number (the SHA hash code) as this is based in part on the time of commit as well as the contents. If you need to squash a commit history that has already been shared you should tell everyone before doing so as they will have to pull the new commit history.

SPC s s - helm-swoop - shows a buffer with all search results, C-j and C-k navigates through results. SPC s p for a project wide search. \\b defines a boundary around the search term. For example search\\b will match search, but not searching.

When in the search state the Evil keybindings act more destructively. Use SPC s s for helm swoop rather than / Text Editing \u03bb\ufe0e The following commands put you into the Evil Insert state Key Action i insert state at cursor I insert state at start of line a append - insert state after cursor A append - insert state at end of line o new line after cursor O new line before cursor Return to Normal state \u03bb\ufe0e Regularly switch between normal and insert states is normal practice in Spacemacs. As soon as you finish typing some new text, it should become second nature to go back to normal state. c Switching from insert to normal state: ESC or press f d keys in extremely quick succession. Hint:: \u03bb\ufe0e Using f d together is low risk as if you dont get it right it will either add the characters or try find the next d character (as f moves to the next character). Keep trying this key combination as once in normal state you can use u to undo any f d characters inserted. The character sequence can be customized or deactivated by adding evil-escape to dotspacemacs-excluded-packages in the ~/.spacemacs configuration file.

To comment multiple lines you can use the repeat command style, especially useful if you are using relative line numbers. g c 3 j will comment the current line and the following two lines below. Comment in reverse using g c 3 k . In Visual state, v , select the lines you wish to comment and use g c to comment all the marked lines. Partially marked lines are not commented. http://spacemacs.org/layers/+vim/evil-commentary/README.html Working with Buffers \u03bb\ufe0e To work with files in Emacs, they are first loaded into a Buffer . So when you open a file with M-x find file or SPC f f a new buffer is created so you can manage that file. Buffers are displayed in a window and you can change the window to show any of the current buffers. Here are the most commonly used buffer commands Key Command Description SPC b b helm-mini List current buffers SPC b d kill-this-buffer Kill current buffer SPC b h home Switch to Spacemacs home page SPC b n next-buffer Switch to next buffer SPC b p previous-buffer Switch to previous buffer SPC b s switch-to-scratch-buffer Switch to the scratch buffer SPC b Y copy-whole-buffer-to-clipboard Copy current buffer contents to kill ring See the full buffer menu via SPC b Managing Files \u03bb\ufe0e Key Description SPC f c copy file - save current buffer with a new file name SPC f R change file name of current buffer SPC f y n yank file name of current buffer Also consider using treemacs and projectile Quit or Restart Emacs \u03bb\ufe0e I recommend using the Spacemacs menu from normal mode to quit / restart Spacemacs. Key Action SPC q q Quit Spacemacs SPS q r Restart Spacemacs keeping current window and buffer layout SPS q R Restart Spacemacs Hint::Work in progress - sorry \u03bb\ufe0e The rest of this section is work in progress and a little messy. Classic Vim commands \u03bb\ufe0e Todo::Reference section \u03bb\ufe0e The classic vim commands are also available, however, I dont think they are as nice to learn. Adding as reference for those used to Vim already and would miss them. Substitution \u03bb\ufe0e key Action :s/old/new substitute new for the first old pattern :s/old/new/g substitute new for all 'old's on a line :#,#s/old/new/g substitute phrases between two line #'s type :%s/old/new/g substitute all occurrences in the file :%s/old/new/gc as above, asking for confirmation each time External commands \u03bb\ufe0e You can run external commands using :! followed by a command. For example: :!ls - run the ls command Spacemacs shell can be configured to pop-up a shell buffer to run commands from the directory of the current buffer. Spelling Checking \u03bb\ufe0e As you are typing in any(?) buffer then Spacemacs is checking your spelling as you type. If you type a word that Spacemacs does not recognise then that word is underscored in red. To correct a spelling: Move to the word that is incorrectly spelt SPC S c to change the word and show a list of suggested words Either type in a new spelling or use C-j and C-k keys to move down and back up the list of words, using RET to select that word. Scrolling \u03bb\ufe0e In evil command mode you can scroll just the text using the classic vi bindings. This does not scroll the cursor unless the cursor hist the top or bottom of the window, in which case the cursor stays at that window boundary. C-y - scroll down C-e - scroll text up Jump around \u03bb\ufe0e SPC j i shows imenu that lists all the def and defn expressions in the current buffer, allowing you to jump to one of these definitions directly by typing its name or using C-j and C-k to select the name and pressing RET to jump to the name in the buffer SPC j l labels each line of the buffer with a short, unique character code. By entering the character code you are taken directly to the specific line. This is the avy goto line function and this works on all visible buffers by default, although it can be just shown on the current buffer (TODO: how is this set).

# Managing Windows

Windows in Spacemacs allow you to organise your buffers, splitting horizontally and vertically with multiple rows and columns.  Windows can also be moved around and resized without resorting to using the mouse.

`SPC w` is the windows menu.

`SPC w u` will undo a change to the windows.

## Golden Ratio - added focus for multiple windows
`SPC t g` toggles golden ratio mode

Golden ratio automatically makes the active window the largest in the frame.  Chainging windows will resize all windows to make the new active window the largest


## Windows Transient menu

`SPC W .` opens the Windows Transient state menu, enabling single character keybindings for window commands, simplifying multiple commands.

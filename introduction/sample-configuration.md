# Sample Spacemacs Configuration

Any customisations made to the standard Spacemacs install are contained in the Github repository [Spacemacs configuration](https://github.com/practicalli/spacemacs-config)

Either [browse the repository online](https://github.com/practicalli/spacemacs-config) or use your favorite git client or the following git clone command:

`git clone https://github.com/practicalli/spacemacs-config.git`

The above command creates a new directory called `spacemacs-config` that contains the configuration examples from this book, all in one place. 

You can use **ediff** in Spacemacs to compare your configuration files with the examples.
